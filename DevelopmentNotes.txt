//Notes


//The test characters for the game will be the Angel Ramiel and Unit 01 for the player

//Animation for Ramiel should be when he is firing (changing shape)

//The Evangelion Unit should be firing the rifle or weapon 

//Pixelate the images, background and the gifs or sprites to make them look similar 

//Add the music 8 bit version 

//Misato will display the stats at the beginning of each battle, and at the end when the enemy is defeated.
